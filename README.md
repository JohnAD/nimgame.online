https://nimgame.online/

a web site for hosting open-source javascript-based games written in the Nim programming language.

## What Kind of Games?

As a requirement, the following conditions must be met:

* must use client-side JavaScript to function
* must be open source and available on a linkable hosted repo
* must be written, at least in part, in Nim.

You can certainly also use other languages and frameworks (in addition to Nim.) For example, I would consider hosting an app written with the Godot framework or Unity framework; as long as it still meets the above conditions.

Technically, I can refuse any game if it is extremely offensive; but I'm actually pretty lax about that kind of thing.

If your game is written to run in a shell environment, I have written a library to help move it to Javascript: [webterminal](https://nimble.directory/pkg/webterminal)

## Contact

*(BTW, repo.support is also written in Nim.)*
